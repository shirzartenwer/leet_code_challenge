# leet code challenge

Documenting my progress on leetcode challenges. It also serves for the purpose of optimising my solution.


## Discovered during coding

```python
count = Counter(nums)  
```

If a `nums` is a list, count is a dictionary ordered by the decreasing frequency of the list member.
The key would be the list element, the value will be the frequency.
